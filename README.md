This is a repository to publish the code and data in the paper: Li F, Maussion F, Wu G, Chen W, Yu Z, Li Y, Liu G (2022). Influence of glacier inventories on ice thickness estimates and future glacier change projections in the Tian Shan range, Central Asia. Journal of Glaciology 1â€“15. https://doi.org/10.1017/jog.2022.60 

The code might be chaotic. If you have any question or need any help, please create an issue or connect me with the E-mail: lifei@itpcas.ac.cn.

### Note:
Since the OGGM really need an RGI-type inventory, so I recode the GAMDAM v2 glacier inventory.

Considering the licence, I didn't publish the recoded GAMDAM v2.

If it is neccessary to you, you can:

1) download the GAMDAM v2 (doi: 10.5194/tc-13-2043-2019), and join it with our data using the "cenlon" $ "cenlat" by yourself.

2) or request the data, and I'll try to connect with the author of GAMDAM v2 to get the licence.
